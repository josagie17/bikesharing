Overview:
Purpose of this analysis is to perform a review of Citi Bike Data for New York City using Tableau. Data will have type modification using Python in Jupyter Notebook..... i use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, i created a set of visualizations to:
    
    Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
    Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
    Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

Summary:

In conclusion, we can observe that NYC Citi Bike had a total of 2,344,224 rides. 1,900,359 of these rides were taken by subscription members, while 443,865 were taken by ad hoc clients. Men made up 65 percent of known clients, while women made up 25 percent of known customers.Peak riding periods were bimodal, ranging from 6 to 10 a.m. and again from 4 to 7 p.m., which corresponded to regular working hours for both genders. The study also looked at the best pick-up and drop-off sites, independent of time. To further analyse the data, I would recommend including visualisations that displayed the top drop off and pick up locations based on peak times to determine which areas facilitated the increase in ridership use; this information could then be used to place pick-up and drop-off locations both within New York and Des Moines. The second visualisation that I would propose is the length of trip duration by gender; this could then be developed to identify why women riders accounted for a considerably lower number of rides than males, with a remedy put in place to promote women riders even more.
